Release is a tool that validates and creates tags against git repos by reading your changelog file.

It is supported for the following git repository providers via APIs:

* Github
* Gitlab
* Bitbucket

If a provider isn't provided to the command it will default to the in built git tagging functionality.

It requires a markdown formatted changelog, with the most recent changes at the top.

The that consists of a version must start with a `h2` markup and have a number afterwards.

An example changelog would be 

```
# Changelog

[//]: <> (Spaces an no spaces on version number lines are for checking regex in unit tests)
## 1.1.0

### Updated
* An update happened

## 1.0.0

### Added

* Initial release

```

the version numbers can be of a format with decimals separating them.

Example formats tha can be used are

```
major
major.minor
major.minor.patch
major.minor.patch.micro
```

***Note: the format must be consistent within the changelog***

## Installation

#### **With Go installed**

If you have go installed, you can install `release` by running the following.

```bash
go get -u github.com/sanjP10/release
```
To find out where `release` was installed you can run `go list -f {{.Target}} github.com/sanjP10/release`

#### **Without Go installed**

You can go to the [releases page](https://github.com/sanjP10/release/releases) and download the binary for your desired operating system and architecture.

For `release` to be used globally add that directory to the `$PATH` environment setting.

# Usage

The two subcommands for release are `validate` and `create`
* `validate` will interrogate the latest version on the changelog file and if it exists for the repository.
If it does exist, and the commit hash provided is the same it will return a successful exit code. Ideally you put this
  as part of your testing phase within your CI/CD.
* `create` will do the same as `validate` and if the tag does not exist it will create the tag for the commit hash provided. You
use this when you want to create a tag for your repo.

These are the flags when a provider is present

```
-username <username>
-password <password/authroization token> 
-repo <owner/org/project>/<repo name>
-changelog <changelog md file>
-hash <commit sha>
-host <host dns> (optional) (default is bitbucket.org, gitlab.com, github.com)
-provider <git provider of choice from gitlab, github and bitbucket>
```

These are the flags when using the default git functionality
```
-username <username for https authentication, optional for ssh key - defaults to git>
-password <password/authroization token for https authentication, optional for ssh key password> 
-changelog <changelog md file>
-hash <commit sha>
-email <email address for tag>
-origin <git https/ssh origin>
-ssh <path to private ssh key, will require ssh to be part of known hosts and regitered with ssh-agent, optional field>
```

## Changelog Notes
The **Github** and **Gitlab** api's also takes the markdown between the version numbers and creates a release with the changelog notes you created.
If you use the default **git** provider the release notes are added as annotations to the tag, so if you run `git show <desired tag>` you can see the notes associated.
**Bitbucket** api does not process any release notes as it is not supported.


## Examples
This is an example `validate` command via bitbucket

```
release validate -username $USER -password $ACCESS_TOKEN -repo owner/repo_name -changelog changelog.md -hash e1db5e6db25ec6a8592c879d3ff3435c5503d03d -provider bitbucket
```
This is an example `validate` command using default git
```
# HTTPS
release validate -username $USER -password $ACCESS_TOKEN -email user@domain.com -origin https://$USER@bitbucket.org/$BITBUCKET_REPO_OWNER/$BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG.git -changelog CHANGELOG.md -hash $BITBUCKET_COMMIT

# SSH
release validate -ssh $PATH_TO_PRIVATEKEY $ACCESS_TOKEN -email user@domain.com -origin git@bitbucket.org/$BITBUCKET_REPO_OWNER/$BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG.git -changelog CHANGELOG.md -hash $BITBUCKET_COMMIT
```

This is an example `create` command via bitbucket

```
release create -username $USER -password $ACCESS_TOKEN -repo owner/repo_name -changelog changelog.md -hash e1db5e6db25ec6a8592c879d3ff3435c5503d03d -provider bitbucket
```
This is an example `create` command using default git
```
# HTTPS
release create -username $USER -password $ACCESS_TOKEN -email user@domain.com -origin https://$USER@bitbucket.org/$BITBUCKET_REPO_OWNER/$BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG.git -changelog CHANGELOG.md -hash $BITBUCKET_COMMIT

# SSH
release create -ssh $PATH_TO_PRIVATEKEY $ACCESS_TOKEN -email user@domain.com -origin git@bitbucket.org/$BITBUCKET_REPO_OWNER/$BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG.git -changelog CHANGELOG.md -hash $BITBUCKET_COMMIT

```

This is an example of `validate` command against a self-hosted bitbucket
```
release validate -username $USER -password $ACCESS_TOKEN -repo owner/repo_name -changelog changelog.md -hash e1db5e6db25ec6a8592c879d3ff3435c5503d03d -host api.mybitbucket.com -provider bitbucket
```

# Outputs

Release when returning with a successful exit code will write the desired or created tag as stdout.

You can in turn take that output and use it with other tag based services such as Docker. To do this you can use tee.

An example script would be
```bash
release create -username $USER -password $ACCESS_TOKEN -repo owner/repo -changelog CHANGELOG.md -hash $COMMIT_HASH -provider github | tee version.txt
docker build . -t myContainer:$(cat version.txt) .
docker push myContainer:${cat version.txt}
```

# Bitbucket Pipeline example
To integrate the `validate` use this in bitbucket pipelines you can use the following as steps

```
- step:
    name: validate version
    image: golang
    script:
      - go get -u github.com/sanjP10/release
      # Test version does not exist
      - release validate -username $USER -password $ACCESS_TOKEN -repo $BITBUCKET_REPO_OWNER/$BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG -changelog CHANGELOG.md -hash $BITBUCKET_COMMIT -provider bitbucket
```

To integrate the `create` use this in the bitbucket pipeline after you merge to master

To integrate this into bitbucket pipelines you can use the following as steps

```
- step:
    name: create version
    image: golang
    script:
      - go get -u github.com/sanjP10/release
      - release create -username $USER -password $ACCESS_TOKEN -repo $BITBUCKET_REPO_OWNER/$BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG -changelog CHANGELOG.md -hash $BITBUCKET_COMMIT -provider bitbucket
```

# Github Actions Example
To integrate the `validate` use this in bitbucket pipelines you can use the following as steps

```

# CodeCommit
CodeCommit only supports SSH

As code commit uses credential-helper to create a username and password it is not possible to get
the username and password for use with HTTPs.

It's required that you use SSH which is only available via IAM Users.

After following the steps in the AWS Documentation of setting up a ssh key as documented [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-ssh-unixes.html#setting-up-ssh-unixes-keys)

You will need to get the SSH Key ID which can be found in the IAM User console.

This would be the command for using the tool when using SSH.
```
release validate -ssh $PATH_TO_PRIVATEKEY -email user@domain.com -origin ssh://$AWS_SSH_KEY_ID@git-codecommit.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/test -username $AWS_SSH_KEY_ID -changelog CHANGELOG.md -hash fb53ed3902bb6ccb0304e28018373033175da272
```

# GCP
Cloud Source Repositories only supports SSH

As source repositories uses gitcookie's to create a username and password it is not possible to get
the username and password for use with HTTPs.

Once you have registered the ssh key within cloud source repositories, the command  would be as follows
```
release validate -ssh $PATH_TO_PRIVATEKEY -email user@domain.com -origin ssh://$ACCOUNT_EMAIL@git-codecommit.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/test -username $ACCOUNT_EMAIL -changelog CHANGELOG.md -hash fb53ed3902bb6ccb0304e28018373033175da272
```

# Azure

Unfortunately neither HTTPs nor SSH due to this [issue](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/64)
